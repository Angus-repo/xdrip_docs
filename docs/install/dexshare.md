### Prerequisites

In order for xDrip+ to receive data from share servers, you need to have:

1. sharing enabled on the Dex app that is connected to the sensor
2. accepted the invitation on the Dex follower app (you can uninstall it afterwards)

Enter the credentials you use to authenticate with Clarity.

!!!warning "Account lock"  
    Leaving xDrip+ with a wrong password will lock your account.  
    In order to recover from an account lock, delete your credentials, [disable xDrip+ collection](../datasource/#changing-data-source) and wait for 15/20 minutes.  
    xDrip+ and any other third party app trying to connect with a bad password will maintain the locked state.

If no data is visible and no error message pops-up you might need to [Start sensor](../../use/startsensor/#followers-and-companion-apps).
