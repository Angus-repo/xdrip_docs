For using xDrip+ with data coming from share servers, you must enter the credentials you use to authenticate with Clarity.

!!!warning "Account lock"  
    Leaving xDrip+ with a wrong password will lock your account.  
    In order to recover from an account lock, delete your credentials, [disable xDrip+ collection](../datasource/#changing-data-source) and wait for 15/20 minutes.  
    xDrip+ and any other third party app trying to connect with a bad password will maintain the locked state.

The same guidelines apply than those for the `bridge` plugin in Nightscout. [Please check here for more information](https://nightscout.github.io/troubleshoot/dexcom_bridge/).
