The Sony Smartwatch 3 (SWR50) and LG Watch Urbane 2nd edition were of the very few smartwatches able to read the Libre sensor with their internal NFC reader, and gave birth to [early projects as a bridge](https://github.com/pimpimmi/LibreAlarm). This is now an archived project, some guidelines are still available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/67jmkj/my_hombrew_android_cgm_build_so_far_sony/).

Most required resources are not available anymore on the web.

xDrip+ supports this feature with the data source LibreAlarm.

## [Patch the SWR50 watch to enable the NFC reader](https://github.com/pimpimmi/LibreAlarm/wiki)

## [Install LibreAlarm on your phone](https://github.com/jamorham/LibreAlarm/releases)

## Install the LibreAlarm watchface on the SWR50

Use [these guidelines](../../smartwatch/wearinstall/#wear-os-1x) for LibreAlarm instead of xDrip+.

## Setup xDrip+ with LibreAlarm data source.

xDrip+ will receive BG readings from the LibreAlarm app.
