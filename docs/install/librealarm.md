The Sony Smartwatch 3 (SWR50) was one of the very few smartwatches able to read the Libre sensor with its internal NFC reader, and gave birth to [early projects as a bridge](https://github.com/pimpimmi/LibreAlarm). This is now an archived project, some guidelines are still available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/67jmkj/my_hombrew_android_cgm_build_so_far_sony/).

Most required resources are not available anymore on the web.

xDrip+ supports this feature with the data source LibreAlarm.

## Install the LibreAlarm watchface on the SWR50

For this you will need to manually upgrade the watch Google Play service using ADB.

xDrip+ will receive BG readings from the LibreAlarm app.
