## Which one to install?

xDrip+ is not available in the Google Play store. You will find all releases in [Github](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).  
You have two main choices when installing xDrip+, either install the Latest release or a Pre-release.

!!!note  
    If you already have xDrip+ installed on your phone you don't need to uninstall it before installing another version.

### Latest release

Latest release is a stable version of xDrip+. It doesn't have all the newest features but has proven stability and doesn't suffer severe bugs. It's a safe version to start with.

You can download it from [here](https://xdrip-plus-updates.appspot.com/stable/xdrip-plus-latest.apk) or follow this QR code:

All xDrip+ versions are available [here](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

Expand the assets and select the `.apk` file. You will find it in your phone's `Downloads` directory.

## Private versions

Some developers add features and customizations that are not available in the official pre-releases until the author will create a Pull Request in xDrip+ and get it merged in the main project.

!!!warning "Updating private versions"  
    You can use these versions but need to understand they might be supported only by their creator.  
    xDrip+ automatic updates won't work with private versions.  
    Also keep in mind you cannot install a private version if you have an official version installed on your phone:  
    you will need to uninstall it first.  
    The same applies for the other way round (from private to official).
