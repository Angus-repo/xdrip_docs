Select this data source if you've setup a device with xDrip+ as master and decided this other device will be the follower.  
A master device is usually the one getting BG from the sensor.  
A follower replicates readings from the master device real time (network latency applies).

There is virtually no limit in the amount of xDrip+ follower devices.

See [here](../../use/syncsetup) how to setup xDrip+ Sync follower.
