### xDrip+ direct integration

xDrip+ offers a wide range of smartwatch support.

#### [Android Wear Integration](../wear)

You'll find the most complete integration in Wear OS watches as they are running a part of the xDrip+ app locally.  
Some of them can be used as standalone collectors (no phone required) when connecting to a sensor (some sensors).

If you need more watchfaces or customizations you can use [Tasker](https://github.com/FreDiabetics/xDrip--Tasker-Tizen-Watchface-Integration/blob/master/README.md) (but not as a standalone collector).

#### [Pebble Integration](../pebble)

Pebble smartwatch use is a historic milestone of CGM in the Cloud. Pebble has been bought by Fitbit in 2016 and resources have moved to archives and [rebble.io](https://rebble.io/).

You need to download the watch app from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/pebble-technology-corp/pebble/pebble-4-4-2-1405-62d45d7d7-endframe-release/pebble-4-4-2-1405-62d45d7d7-endframe-android-apk-download/).

#### [AmazFit Sync Service](https://crazyinfo.de/2018/07/25/xdrip-smartwatch-widget-fuer-amazfit-pace-stratos/)

AmazFit was used only for Pace and Stratos models.  
You cannot use this feature for other AmazFit watches.

#### [BlueJay Watch](https://bluejay.website/)

BlueJay is an incredible companion of your Dexcom sensor, with or without xDrip+, with or without phone.

#### [LeFun Band](https://www.lefunsmart.com/collections/smartwatches)

LeFun band integration was an early implementation for smartbands, best if used in mmol/l.  
Unless you still own a LeFun W3, F3, F3S, F11 or F12 band this is not of any use now.

#### [MiBand](../miband)

MiBand integration is the result of the huge work of [Artem](https://bigdigital.home.blog/).  
Many smartwatches and smartbands are now supported using the companion app WatchDrip+.

If you use WatchDrip+ you should disable MiBand.

#### Smartwatch Sensors

xDrip+ can use supported smartwatches sensors.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW8.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

When available you can let xDrip+ collect health data like heartrate and steps.

<img src="../images/M-S-SW8a.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Two additional icons will appear on the main view, and if enabled, a graphic representations:

1.  A dark blue graph for heartrate
2. A light cyan cloud line for steps

<img src="../images/M-S-SW8c.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

xDrip+ can request the heartbeat sensor to activate and you can smooth that graph.

### Other smartwatches

More smartwatches and devices can receive data from xDrip+ even if they are not directly integrated in the app.

!!!info  
    In order to have xDrip+ send data you need to enable xDrip+ [web service](../../use/interapp#web-service).
