In this menu you can select the units used by xDrip+ (mg/dl or mmol/l) and set high and low targets.  
These two targets will decide when the graph BG dots change color above or below target.

You need to authorize xDrip+ to access the phone camera.

You can then scan the QR code displayed on another phone in order to copy the settings you selected when displaying it as explained here.
