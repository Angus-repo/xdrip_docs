Update settings allows you to choose between various xDrip+ versions update.

!!!warning "DO NOT UNINSTALL xDRIP+"  
    You can upgrade and downgrade xDrip+ just installing a newer or an older version on top of the current one.  
    Uninstalling xDrip+ might lead to complete and unrecoverable data loss if you don't [backup](../../troubleshoot/reinstall/#reinstall-xdrip).

!!!warning  
    Only xDrip+ official versions can use this feature.  
    If you installed a [private version](../../install/download/#private-versions), only the author can provide upgrades. 

!!!note  
    Updating xDrip+ is completely transparent and will not require any specific actions on your current sensor.  
    Your settings will be maintained unless a serious modification was made on a specific setting.  
    As a precaution it's better to keep xDrip+ monitored if you selected an alpha or nightly release.

You can enable automatic update check.

If you leave it disabled xDrip+ will remind you to update every 60 days.

There are four update channels:

- Stable: released versions that proved stability and reliability
- Beta: versions that are candidates to stable release
- Alpha: versions in development
- Nightly: prototypes for testing

Most tested versions will not include latest features.

Less tested versions might include bugs.

You need to decide based on the familiarity you have with xDrip+ and safety considerations.

### Update

Update available notifications will trigger based on your channel selection.  
You can manually request a check if you disabled automatic update check using the [3 dots menu](../3dotsmenu/#check-for-updated-version).

1. The currently update channel will be displayed
2. Current and newer (available) versions
3. Download now will start the update download, Android will ask for the install authorization when download is complete.
4. You can disable automatic updates. This has the same effect than the automatic update check button above.
5. If you don't use the internal downloader, your device will use the default app for downloading internet files.
6. Exit without doing anything.

If selecting the internal downloader you will see a progress bar and once complete, the install will start automatically.

If you didn't select the internal downloader your phone will download the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases) and launch the install once complete.

No new permissions should be required.
