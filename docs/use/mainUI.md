### Meet the user interface

Welcome to xDrip+!

<img src="../images/UI-basic.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

If you've just setup xDrip+ you want to start with basic customizations:

1. [Setup the unit you want to display your blood glucose with](../settings)
2. [Add alarms](../alarms)
3. If you're connecting xDrip+ to a sensor, share data
4. Display xDrip+ on the phone when screen is locked
5. Add a widget to your phone home screen
6. Add a smartwatch

### Basic indications

You will see these default indications when xDrip+ receives data.

<img src="../images/UI-indications.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

1. How long ago was the reading received and what's the BG difference with the previous value received.
2. What's the last measured BG value.
3. What's the trend in respect with the previous measurement.

!!!note "Trend arrow"  
    Note that the arrow gives the trend difference with the previous measurement, other CGM applications use an algorithm to give this indication and the result might not match.  
    In case of missing readings, the arrow might indicate fast rise or drop, always correlate with the indication in `1`.

You can customize the information shown in `1` with Graph Settings.

You can [customize the trend arrow aspect](#blood-drop-menu) but not behavior.

### Treatments

You can log treatments with the syringe icon.

<img src="../images/UI-Treat.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Add one or more elements to your treatment.

Blood test (in the unit selected in xDrip+)

<img src="../images/UI-Treat1.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Grams of carbs

<img src="../images/UI-Treat2.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Units of insulin

<img src="../images/UI-Treat3.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

And eventually the time of the treatment expressed in 24 hours format, with (recommended) or without a separator.

<img src="../images/UI-Treat4.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Treatments are valid when the green check mark appears in the upper right corner. Touch it to confirm the entries.

<img src="../images/UI-Treat6.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

A summary is displayed. Touch the green `+` icon to confirm or red `x` icon to discard.

<img src="../images/UI-Treat5.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Once done, new symbols will appear on your graph.

Units and carbs show like this:

<img src="../images/UI-Treat7.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

And blood tests like this (note the symbol is square unlike calibrations that are round):

<img src="../images/UI-Treat8.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

When visible, you can delete treatments like this:

- Touch the treatment, look at the bottom of the screen: touch Add Note or Blood Test.

<img src="../images/UI-Treat9.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

- You can enter a note or touch Delete to delete the entry. This applies to blood tests, carbs and insulin.

<img src="../images/UI-Treat10.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Note that if you touch a blood test and edit it you can also convert it to a calibration using Calibrate.

<img src="../images/UI-Treat11.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

You can use the microphone icon to verbally enter treatments.

### Treatment notes

Independently of treatments you can enter notes.

<img src="../images/UI-Note.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Enter the comment you want (like slow acting insulin units), or use the microphone icon to speak the note.

<img src="../images/UI-Note1.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

They will be added to the graph like this:

<img src="../images/UI-Note2.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

By touching them you can edit or delete them.

### Main menu

Also called hanburger or drawer menu, this is the main menu in which you'll be able to find or place the most common actions you need and also all settings and customizations.

<img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

Look [here](../hamburger) for more information.

### Blood drop menu

With a long touch on the central area between main and three dots menu you can open another menu for customizing the user interface.

<img src="../../images/UImenu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

`Source Wizard Button` shows the button driving you through the data source selection as described [here](../../install/datasource).

<img src="../../install/images/Install12.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

`Show Time Buttons` adds a row of four presets for the main graph time range: 24, 12, 6 and 3 hours.

<img src="../images/UI-TimeButtons.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

`Show Chart Preview` enables or disables the 24 hours small chart in the lower screen area.

<img src="../images/UI-ChartPreview.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

`Show Collector Status` shows information messages regarding the collector status below the main graph.

<img src="../images/UI-CollStatus.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

`Show Sensor Expiry` displays the remaining time before sensor expiry below the main graph.

<img src="../images/UI-SensorExpiry.png" style="zoom:75%;" />

`Show Graphical Trend Arrow` adds an option allowing you to select other arrow styles.

Use the wrench and drop down menu to select them.  
Color arrows include a hue cursor to change color. 

Graphical trend arrows angle depends on the reading difference with the previous value (5 minutes) and not only flat/45/90 degree like the classic arrows.

<img src="../images/UI-GraphicArrow.png" style="zoom:90%;" />

### Three dots menu

This menu contains some shortcuts to settings and other unique functions.
